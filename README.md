# EAGE_Hackathon_2017
This is the result of the Agile 2017 Paris Hackathon, a weekend of coding among friends with geophysical and computational skills.

## Scope of Project
We aim to help seismic interpreters in detecting features of interest within seismic data using Machine Learning techniques.

Haar Cascade classifiers are commonly used to identify faces or object in photos and video streams. We have adopted the very same approach
for seismic data by taking advantage of [OpenCV library](http://opencv.org) routines. So far we have trained Haar Cascade to detect seismic
traps and faults (as well as beer bottles!), but we plan to train our model on other seismic features in the near future.
